<!-- Instructions: Welcome to VS Code! If you've never been, or aren't well acquainted, take a moment to check out the README.md file first to get the basics down. You can find that to the left of this window pane, in the "Files" section. More on that in the README.md! -->

    <!-- Instructions: First, change the title of the page within the title tag to be "My First HTML Project". You can test if this worked by hitting the "Go Live" button near the bottom right corner in the blue tool ribbon below!  -->
    <!-- This will launch a local host session of your project in the browser, usually at an address like http://localhost:3000 or similar. This will enable you to view your work as you go! If the button isn't there, check the "extensions" tab at the far left and search for "live-server" and install. Then reopen your vs code and it should be available! Use this often! :) -->

    <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "div" element, apply a class called "container", and an id called "divOne" -->
    <div id="divOne" class="container"></div>

    <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "h1" element and set the text content to "Hello, World!" -->
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

    <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "p" element and set the text content to "This is my first coding project using HTML!" -->
    <p>This is my first coding project using HTML!</p>

    <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "img" element and set the "src" attribute to "image.jpg" -->
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="savvy-coders logo" />

    <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "a" element and set the "href" attribute to "https://github.com/savvy-coders" and the content (the text the user sees corresponding with that link) should be "Savvy Coders on GitHub, where I'm learning to code!" -->
    <a href="https://github.com/savvy-coders"
      >Savvy Coders on GitHub, where I'm learning to code!</a
    >

    <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "form" element and set the "action" attribute to "submit". It won't do anything for now, because that form submission needs JavaScript to work, and also because we haven't really dug into form fields very deeply yet. For now, we're just practicing the syntax! -->
    <form action="submit"></form>
